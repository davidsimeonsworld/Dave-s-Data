INSIGHT INTO WORK DONE : 

Every CEO or company executive is in business primarily to satisfy clients/customers and then secondarily for the purpose of making money. This two factors are connected as the primary reason can determine the extent to which the secondary reason is achieved so an excellent company focuses more on their clients to ensure they are adequately satisfied that way consistent flow of income is guaranteed.

In dealing with clients/customers, a lot of companies encounter a challenge in retaining a percentage of clients and this cannot be ignored because it can lead to the end of the company if not properly managed. usually a company keeps records in their database and with the help of a data analyst are able to draw out useful insights for quality decision making. Having a Data Analyst in your team becomes a plus as he would help out in combing the grey areas that yourself and possible competitors are not looking into just yet.

Customer Retention therefore is the art that ensures the customers you worked so hard to acquire stays with you and continues to patronize you for as long as possible. It varies from Field to Field but when properly understood, it serves as a strong bait in getting other spilled fishes(clients from other competitors) and a stronghold in keeping your already achieved customers. 

Some Factors to look out for in Customer Retention includes ;

1. Churn Rate ; The Measure of Clients that exited your patronage within a period of time

2. Customer Satisfaction ; How well a customer is satisfied and what you need to do to achieve that.
